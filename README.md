gem 'spree_contentful'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_contentful:install

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake

Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
